# Text-Adventure

A user input driven text based adventure. The goal was to sharpen my skills with functions and nested functions.
Additionally, have a .exe game to play and have a laugh with family and friends.  

I purposely did not seperate the functions into different modules and import them in as my main goal was the .exe file.  
I may build on this in the future and utilize different modules and files to import into the game play file.
